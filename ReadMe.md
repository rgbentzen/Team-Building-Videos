## Team Building Videos

### Purpose 
Online training videos that define the key stages of Team Building for new Officers.

### Distribution
English and French, intended for YouTube playback, for National access via the CIC DL Channel and linked specifically within the Intermediate Officer Training Course (IOTC) that is delivered via the Defence Learning Network

### Roles/Responsibility
I edited and adjusted a provided script so as to make a “speaking script”, engaged an external company and voice talent, and directed the recording session to produce the final audio segments.  I directed the summer placement student from an Animation program to create the characters, animation and synchronize with the audio tracks that were previously recorded.

### Approach
The approach to use animated characters was two-fold; our budget was limited, so to hire on-camera talent and production crew would have been prohibitive, and secondly, we wanted to abstract the people from the training concept - hopefully thereby making the viewer focus on the content instead of the people aspects. We worked with an off-the-shelf animation tool (goanimate.com), and we paid for some customization for the characters to be Canadian Armed Forces centric.

### Instructions for review
I have provided the video “Team Forming” for your review, and all the videos can be found via the public access YouTube channel for CIC Officers, http://youtube.com/cicdl.
